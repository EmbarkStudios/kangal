# Kangal User Flow

We expect users to communicate with Kangal by only using API, which is provided by Kangal Proxy.

>You can import [openapi.json](../openapi.json) file to your Postman and have a collection of requests to Kangal. 

Here is an example of requests users can send to Kangal API to manage their load test.

#### Create 
Create a new load test by making a POST request to Kangal Proxy.
> This example CURL command uses JMeter loadtest type and jmx test file.
> Other load generator types may require other data in request.

```

#### Live monitoring
Get logs and monitor your tests. 
Example of monitoring for JMeter described [here](jmeter-in-kangal/Reporting-in-JMeter.md#live-metrics-reporting)
You can also monitor the behavior of your service with your custom tools e.g. Graphite.

```
curl -X GET \
  http://${KANGAL_PROXY_ADDRESS}/load-test/loadtest-name/logs
```

#### Get static report. 
When the test is finished successfully Kangal will save the report, generated by the backend the S3 bucket. 

The report for a particular test can be found by the link `https://${KANGAL_PROXY_ADDRESS}/load-test/loadtest-name/report/`

#### Delete 
Delete your finished load test
